# Fantastic-Recipe-Project
This project will demostrate my HTML development as well as act as a marker for the beginning of my coding process. This project will demostrate that I can create absolute links, relative links, and images to a HTML project. It will demonstrate that my use Vscode to edit my code. It will also demonstate the use of gitHUB and my ability to create and accurately maintain a repository. This project will also show how I can use the terminal to set up a gitHUB project. 

Overall, this project is a starting point for my coding journey!
